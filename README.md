## Two variants

This project consists of two variants: www.l-h-o-o-q.org and www.i-m-too-sad-to-tell-you.org. Both use a Google CSE (Custom Search Engine) to obtain images. Images are cached and a simple 50-50 chance is defined for either loading a new image from Google or returning an existing one. This is done to reduce the amount of requests to the Google CSE for which we have to pay.

## Key

Indeed, the API-key is missing. It's supposed to be in a file called `k.php`. Get one via the Google developer console.
